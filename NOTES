Have make release change PATCHLEVEL to 0  (PatchLevel.h),
  and generate a note to bump VERSION in Imakefile right away.
=> need to weed out Imakefile changes for patch releases,
   changing PATCHLEVEL for each patch release
Could a make patchrelease target be constructed?  (is it worth it?)

920823(11:19) Anthony Daniel <tony@sequent.com> pointed out I should run
lint to catch stuff.  Done.  Apparently his lint caught sprintf argument
warnings where mine under RISC/os does not.  He offered diffs for resulting
fixes he's made.  These are caught by IRIX lint. 

In addition, Tony wanted <X11/Xm> includes to be <Xm>, so he could to
a simple #define (his Xm is elsewhere).  But this forces everyone to 
define... need to suggest he create a symbolic link in /usr/include/X11.

o davidf had trouble getting started.  Rather than:

	Click me for clues.  Scale on right controls autoplay.

  perhaps the initial message should say:

	Place your bet using the scale on the left.

  Or change to that.
  Or distinguish sensitive bet scale better
	(don't use the same font as won, lost,...)
	(depend on color or extra shading)

o Make second click on autoplay slider stop where ever it is.
(only stops when your at the bottom right now)

o Ensure it runs on cow (NCD).

o Make a single ManageHelpDialogCB for all Help menu items.
  (Have ManageHelpDialogCB() recognize which to Manage.)

o Need to drain extraneous Expose/Resize DrawingAreaCB events.

o Manage composite widgets last (separate ManageWidgets call?)

o Get resources into fallback form.
  (So we can run without a resource file).

o Growing (memory leak).  Not as bad under 5.0/4.10 (Motif 1.1.3).
  Can run overnight now.  Need Purify.

o Options Menu:
	Default bankroll	[0,maxint]              200	scale
	Table minimum 		[0,maxint]		1	scale
	Shuffle up before deal	[1,decks*52]		6	scale
	Shuffle during hand	[1,decks*52]		0	scale
	Total Decks 		1, 2, 7			1	radiobox
	Dealer Hits Soft 17	Yes, No			No	button
	Dealer peeks on TEN	Yes, No			No	button
	May Double Down		9, 10, 11, anyTwoCards	10,11	combobox

o Action Menu:
	Shuffle (Shuffle up now)
	Restart (Start over over, clearing won/lost stats)
  Is it against the style guide to make these 2 menubar buttons?
  (Should all menubar children be cascades?) 

o Additional entries for charts if any two cards can be doubled.
  If you can double down on 9 (which is true in some Reno casinos),

920708(14:26) Placed a blackjack program for X on export (in contrib):

-rw-r--r--  1 ftp	128745 Jul  8 21:16 xblackjack-1.3.tar.Z

Should not have -lbsd on EXTRA_LIBRARIES .. most won't have this.

-rw-r--r--  1 ftp	150231 Aug 18 17:38 xblackjack-2.0.tar.Z

920818(10:56) Announced xblackjack-2.0 in:
	comp.windows.x.announce
	comp.windows.x.motif
	comp.windows.open-look
	rec.gambling

Next day on:
	comp.windows.x.apps

Generating the following under IRIX (go):
	rm -f XBlackjack.ad
	ln -s XBlackjack.MOTIF XBlackjack.ad
	ln: XBlackjack.MOTIF and XBlackjack.ad are identical.
	*** Error code 2

This seems to say that the rm is not working...

920821(10:08) I have also recently noticed a problem with the bet slider
'running away' when the insurance question dialog appears.  I'll have
to look into that next.
